This document explains how to install Ingress APISIX on [ali-cloud ACK](https://www.aliyun.com/product/kubernetes).

## Prerequisites

* Create an ACK Service on ali-cloud.
* Download the kube config for your ACK, follow the [introduction](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/zh/doc-detail/86378.html).
* Install [Helm](https://helm.sh/).
* **Make sure your target namespace exists**, `kubectl` operations thorough this document will be executed in namespace `ingress-apisix`.

## Install APISIX and apisix-ingress-controller

As the data plane of apisix-ingress-controller, [Apache APISIX](http://apisix.apache.org/) can be deployed at the same time using Helm chart.

```shell
helm repo add apisix https://charts.apiseven.com
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
helm repo update
kubectl create ns ingress-apisix
helm install apisix apisix/apisix \
  --set gateway.type=LoadBalancer \
  --set ingress-controller.enabled=true \
  --set etcd.persistence.storageClass="alicloud-disk-ssd" \
  --set etcd.persistence.size="20Gi" \
  --namespace ingress-apisix
kubectl get service --namespace ingress-apisix
```

Five Service resources were created.

* `apisix-gateway`, which processes the real traffic;
* `apisix-admin`, which acts as the control plane to process all the configuration changes.
* `apisix-ingress-controller`, which exposes apisix-ingress-controller's metrics.
* `apisix-etcd` and `apisix-etcd-headless` for etcd service and internal communication.

The gateway service type is set to `LoadBalancer` (See [Access services through SLB](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/182218.htm) for more details), so that clients can access Apache APISIX through a load balancer. You can find the load balancer ip by running:

```shell
kubectl get service apisix-gateway --namespace ingress-apisix -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[].ip}'
```

`ACK` PV require min_size is `20Gi`,cluster with `flexVolume` component select `alicloud-disk-ssd`,if with `helm values.yml` configure startup `apisix`,[more helm etcd configure](https://hub.kubeapps.com/charts/bitnami/etcd),configure format sample:

```yaml
etcd:
  persistence:
    storageClass: "alicloud-disk-ssd"
    size: 20Gi
```

Try to create some [resources](https://github.com/apache/apisix-ingress-controller/tree/master/docs/en/latest/concepts) to verify the running status. As a minimalist example, see [proxy-the-httpbin-service](../practices/proxy-the-httpbin-service.md) to learn how to apply resources to drive the apisix-ingress-controller.
